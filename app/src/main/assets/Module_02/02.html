    <h1>Module 2: Amazon EC2 Instance Types</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>What Are EC2 Instance Types?</h2>
        <p>Amazon EC2 instance types are virtual servers created to fulfil a variety of application requirements. They are optimized for certain workloads by providing various computation, memory, storage, and networking configurations.</p>
        <p>Each instance is part of a family, each of which is built for a certain use case. This flexibility enables you to choose the optimum instance type for your workload requirements, ensuring cost efficiency and optimal performance.</p>
        <h3>EC2 Instance Types:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>General Purpose Instances</li>
            <li>Compute Optimized Instances</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Analogy:</h3>
        <p>Imagine a cashier in a coffee shop—their job requires them to handle customer orders quickly, so they rely on their memory and efficiency to ensure everything is accurate and fast.</p>
        <h3>When to Use:</h3>
        <p>Choose these instances for workloads that require huge volumes of data to be preloaded into memory before processing, resulting in faster performance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Accelerated Computing Instances</h2>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> These instances utilize hardware accelerators (coprocessors) to accomplish specified tasks more effectively than a CPU.</p>
        <h3>Use Cases:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Graphics-intensive applications.</li>
            <li>Game and application streaming.</li>
