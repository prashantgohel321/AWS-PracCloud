        <h2>What AWS Offers</h2>
        <p>AWS is a comprehensive cloud platform providing services for various business needs. These services range from basic computing tools to highly specialized solutions.</p>
        <p>Imagine you’re building a city:</p>
        <h3>Basic Services</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compute:</strong> Virtual servers, container services, and serverless computing to run applications. These are like construction workers who build and maintain buildings (applications).</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Secure and scalable options like Amazon S3 for file storage and Amazon EBS for block storage. Think of this as warehouses storing essential city supplies.</li>
            <li><strong>Networking and Security:</strong> Tools for secure data transfer, VPNs, and firewalls. These are the city’s roads, gates, and security checkpoints.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Advanced Solutions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Secure platforms for managing decentralized applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML) and AI:</strong> Smart city planners analyzing data for future trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Robotic Development Platforms:</strong> Engineers creating automated systems like drones or self-driving vehicles.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Specialized Services</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Media Services:</strong> Platforms for video production and live streaming.</li>
            <li><strong>Orbital Satellites:</strong> Services like AWS Ground Station for managing satellite communications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding the Cloud Compute Model</h2>
        <p>AWS services are based on the <strong>client-server model</strong>, which is fundamental to modern IT architecture.</p>
        <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Client:</strong> A user or application that makes a request, such as uploading a file or analyzing data.</li>
            <li><strong>Server:</strong> A virtual machine that processes and fulfills the client’s request.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Real-World Analogy:</strong> A coffee shop:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The customer (client) orders coffee.</li>
            <li>The barista (server) prepares the coffee and serves it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In AWS, EC2 instances act as servers handling client requests.</p>

        <h2>AWS Key Value: Pay for What You Use</h2>
        <p>One of AWS’s key advantages is its <strong>pay-as-you-go</strong> pricing model.</p>
        <h3>Traditional IT Challenges:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Businesses must buy hardware upfront, leading to wasted resources.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>AWS Solution:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Resources scale up or down based on demand, optimizing cost.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Coffee Shop Analogy:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hiring employees only when demand is high.</li>
            <li>Similarly, AWS charges only for the resources used.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why AWS?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> No need to buy expensive hardware upfront.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Resources can be increased or decreased as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> AWS has global data centers ensuring smooth operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Broad Range of Services:</strong> Solutions for all industries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is a Client-Server Model?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>client-server model</strong> is a key concept in computing.</p>
        <p>A client (web browser, app) makes a request, and a server (Amazon EC2) fulfills it.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A user requests a news article or video.</li>
            <li>The server processes the request and returns the content.</li>
        </ul>
